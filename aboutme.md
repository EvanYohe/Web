### About me!

More often than not when I read about me pages, I'm bombarded with surface level information and mundane facts that give me a cursory glimpse into the life of whoever happened to write that page, but this about me is going to be a little different. Instead of writing about the things I do, where I live, and what my hobbies are, I'm going to talk a little about my pursuit of happiness and my lifelong journey to find purpose; after all, that is what most of us are looking for, happiness and purpose.

When I was twelve, I read about a Japanese concept called 'Ikigai'. It translates into "a reason for being" and I have carried this ideal with me to this day. It is a venn diagram of four overlapping circles and at the center of these circles I have always though of as purpose.

Despite my being an egomaniac and complete narcissist, I've always found writing About me pages especially hard. I'm a 21 year old college student living just a few miles away from Seattle, Washington. I've lived in the Pacific Northwest my entire life and it has really shaped my wanderlust into something I'd consider quite formitable. I often find myself wanting to drop everything and go explore the United States; maybe someday I'll include a section on the blog where I document some of my camping trips. I'm absolutely in love with cooking and baking and feel more at home in my kitchen than almost anywhere else. There's something about the ability to invoke such strong emotions (particularly joy) that makes me happy. As you may already be able to tell by wandering onto a blog with the word 'amp' in the title, I play both acoustic and electric guitar and love to build and design guitar amps, as well as pedals and guitars themselves.

I'm going to college to get a degree in a field of engineering with a minor in mathematics. I haven't decided which discipline I'll pursue, either mechanical or electrical, however I have narrowed it down to those two.
