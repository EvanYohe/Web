  <h2> News and Updates to the site!</h2>

  <p>June 1st, 2019</p>
  <p> The site if officially up and running. I've got everything squared away for the most part so from now on I'll start trying to get content on the site. I'll porbably start with a bunch of lessons on some basic electronics that we'll use later in the first project that I have planned out.</p>
