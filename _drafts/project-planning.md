### How I plan my Projects.

We've all got things we want to do. Dreams and things we want to see accomplished. And everyone has there own way of starting, working through, and finishing projects. In this post I'll share a little bit about how I go through my project process.  There are three big steps to my project process; planning, preparations, and troubleshooting. I'll talk about two projects that I have decided to embark on and how I'll go about using my three-ish step process to help take these projects from just that to a reality. The two projects are a really more like one and a half projects. One is a guitar amplifier designed and built from scratch, by hand. And the second is a guitar to go along with, however the guitar isn't made from scratch. I plan on taking a second hand guitar and upgrading and setting up the guitar, along with some cosmetic works that will give the guitar a soulful look.

### The Importance of Improvising

This little topic is worthy of an entire post of its own however it is important to note the role improvisation plays in my process as I often refer to it as a three-ish step process. I won't fully cover this here but I will touch on it a little. 

Improvising is often seen as a measure of last resort. Something that can and should only be considered when there are no other options or when your faced with a time sensitive decision. It usually has unforeseen consequences.

### Planning

This is without a shadow of a doubt, hands down, the most important part of every project I start, and undoubtedly where I find my shortcomings. The amount of time spent in the planning stage significantly reduces time spent in the other two major steps on the process. It's impossible to think of every possible variable but in this stage we try our best. The more variables you can account for, the smoother your process will be and it will limit the amount of improvising you need to do. In the section above, I talked about the positive impact of improvising in a project however it can just as easily have negative effects as well. In any project, there are decisions you make that affect the way you do other things and as always, if you change one part of a project, that change can cascade down in unseen ways that cause more cascading changes and more improvising in a large domino effect.

For example, let's dive into the first project that I mentioned earlier, the guitar amp. I just so happened to be in the planning stage with this project as we speak so I'll talk about the progress I've been making.
