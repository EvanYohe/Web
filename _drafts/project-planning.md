### How I plan my Projects.

We've all got things we want to do. Dreams we want to see accomplished, and everyone has their own way of starting, working through, and finishing projects. In this post I'll share a little bit about how I go through my project process.  There are three big steps to my project process; planning, building, and troubleshooting. I'll talk about a projects that I am currently working on and how I go about using my three-ish step process to help take this projects from just that to a reality. The project is a guitar amplifier designed and built from scratch, by hand. At first glance, this may not seem like such a significant undertaking, but if you've read any of the other posts I've made about the inner workings of a valve guitar amp then you'll have quite a good idea at how much depth and detail is going into this project. Using this project as an example will help show how my process helps take a very detailed and nuanced project, such as this one, and breaks it down into manageable chunks that are much easier to work through.

### The Difference Between the Big Three

Before we get into the nitty gritty of my project process, I want to take a second to very clearly differentiate my method from two other similar methods, one you've probably heard about, and one you might not have. They are the scientific and engineering method. This is a very rough description of the three methods that will help you see how they work and how they are different.

* The scientific method takes an observation, forms an explanation for the observation (the hypothesis), and creates a test to either prove or disprove your hypothesis.
* The engineering method follows three basic steps to come up with solutions to problems. The general steps are ideate, or brainstorm ideas to fix the problem. Create, or build/develop your idea to help solve the problem. And iterate, or improve on your creation to make it work better. This is a **VERY** loose definition of the engineering method and I will make a whole post on this later but for now it'll help differentiate between the three processes.
* My personal project process follows three steps similar to the engineering process above. First you plan and prepare anything and everything you can before you start the second step, building, This is where you actually get your hands dirty and working through your plans from the first part. And finally you troubleshoot. No project goes perfectly from start to finish and there is always at least one thing that goes wrong, which is where the troubleshooting step comes in handy.

In general, the scientific method is useful for explaining observations and natural phenomenon by means of experimentation, the engineering method is used as a problem solving tool, and my project process is used individually on a project by project basis seeing how no two projects are the same. It may seem like these methods and processes all walk the same line but the fundamental differences in how we use these methods define them.

### Planning

This is without a shadow of a doubt, hands down, the most important part of every project I start, and undoubtedly where I find my shortcomings. The amount of time spent in the planning stage significantly reduces time spent in the other two major steps on the process. It's impossible to think of every possible variable but in this stage we try our best. The more variables you can account for, the smoother your process will be and it will limit the amount of improvising you need to do. In the section above, I talked about the positive impact of improvising in a project however it can just as easily have negative effects as well. In any project, there are decisions you make that affect the way you do other things and as always, if you change one part of a project, that change can cascade down in unseen ways that cause more cascading changes and more improvising in a large domino effect. 

For example, let's dive into the first project that I mentioned earlier, the guitar amp. I just so happened to be in the planning stage with this project as we speak so I'll talk about the progress I've been making.
